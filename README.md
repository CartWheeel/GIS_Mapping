# Overview
In this program I explored some of the capabilities of GIS mapping through JavaScript. My main goals where to better understand what GIS mapping is, get familiar with the tools, and display a map with some points. My stretch goal is to display a map that would show the currently open and fast-food in the area chosen.

# Development Environment

I programmed in VS Code using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Useful Websites

* [ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/)
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

# Future Work

* Fix API key to properly display on my own machine.
* Adjust clickpoint to instead be window view.
* Add widget to add places to go to and automatically use best routing.
* Implement clock to read current time and only display places currently open.
